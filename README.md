##  Overview

JAX-in-Cell is an open-source project in Python that uses JAX to speedup simulations, leading to a simple to use, fast and concise code. It can be imported in a Python script using the **jaxincell** package, or run directly in python using its `simulation()` function. To install it, use

   ```sh
   pip install jaxincell
   ```

Alternatively, you can simple install the Python dependencies `jax`, `jax_tqdm` and `matplotlib`, and run the `main.py` script in the repository after downloading it as

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

This allows JAX-in-Cell to be run without any installation.

The project can be downloaded in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uwplasma/JAX-in-Cell)
</code>

##  Features

JAX-in-Cell can run in CPUs, GPUs and TPUs, has autodifferentiation and just-in-time compilation capabilities, is based on rigorous testing, uses CI/CD via GitHub actions and has detailed documentation.

Currently, it evolves particles using the non-relativisic Lorentz force $\mathbf F = q (\mathbf E + \mathbf v \times \mathbf B)$, and evolves the electric $\mathbf E$ and magnetic $\mathbf B$ field using Maxwell's equations.

Plenty of examples are provided in the `examples` folder, and the documentation can be found in [Read the Docs](https://jax-in-cell.readthedocs.io/).

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** Python

Besides Python, JAX-in-Cell has minimum requirements. These are stated in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), and consist of the Python libraries `jax`, `jax_tqdm` and `matplotlib`. These can be installed using

   ```sh
   pip install jax jax_tqdm matplotlib
   ```

###  Installation

Install JAX-in-Cell using one of the following methods:

**Using PyPi:**

1. Install JAX-in-Cell from anywhere in the terminal:
```sh
pip install jaxincell
```

**Build from source:**

1. Clone the JAX-in-Cell repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/uwplasma/JAX-in-Cell
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd JAX-in-Cell
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

4. Install JAX-in-Cell:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

###  Usage
To run a simple case of JAX-in-Cell, you can run the file [main.py](main.py) directly
```sh
python main.py
```

There, you can find most of the input parameters needed to run many test cases, as well as resolution parameters.
The `jaxincell` package has a single function `simulation()` that takes as arguments a dictionary input_parameters, the number of grid points, number of pseudoelectrons, total number of time steps, and the field solver to use.

In the [main.py](main.py) file we write as inline comments the meaning of each input parameter.

###  Testing
Run the test suite using the following command:
```sh
pytest .
```
